# Simple Name List Prototype

This is a small Android application built with Jetpack Compose to demonstrate fundamental concepts of UI, state management, and user input. The app provides a simple interface for a user to enter names into a text field and add them to a list that is displayed on the screen.

## Features

- **Add Names**: A `TextField` to enter a first name.
- **Submit Button**: A `Button` with an `Icon` to add the current name to the list.
- **Dynamic List**: A vertically scrolling `Column` that displays all the names that have been added.
- **Modern UI**: Styled using Material 3 components in Jetpack Compose.
- **State Management**: Uses `remember` and `mutableStateListOf` to manage the state of the input field and the list of names, persisting correctly across screen rotations.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The core programming language.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Android's modern, declarative UI toolkit used for building the entire user interface.
- **Material 3**: The design system used for styling components like `TextField`, `Button`, and `Icon`.
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development.
